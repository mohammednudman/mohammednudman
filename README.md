# 💫 About Me
Hi, I’m **Mohammed Nudman Raza Shaikh** 👋  
Backend Engineer with 2+ years of experience building **scalable, distributed, and low-latency systems** in **Go, TypeScript, and C++**.  

- ⚡ Designed backend services handling **millions of concurrent requests** with **sub-100ms latency**.  
- 🗄️ Specialized in **multi-tenant architectures, database sharding, and advanced PostgreSQL optimization**.  
- 🔄 Experienced in **event-driven systems** with Kafka & RabbitMQ.  
- ☁️ Skilled in deploying fault-tolerant applications using **Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and GCP**.  
- 🛠 Strong foundation in **compiler optimization and performance engineering** from earlier C++ work.  

I focus on **efficiency, scalability, and reliability** — whether at the data layer, infra layer, or distributed systems level.

# 📈 Experience Highlights
**Numrah (Backend Developer)**  
- Built **multi-tenant backend systems** in Go + TypeScript with PgCAT-based sharding, improving database replication efficiency by **40%**.  
- Engineered infrastructure to process **millions of concurrent requests**, ensuring **P99 latency under 100ms**.  
- Reduced **PostgreSQL/AlloyDB query latency** (P90 → 80ms) via materialized views, stored procedures, and query tuning.  
- Enhanced **WebRTC TURN server performance**, cutting connection latency from **5s → 1–2s**.  
- Automated delivery with **CI/CD pipelines + comprehensive testing** (unit, integration, E2E).  

**Smowcode (C++ Developer)**  
- Enhanced compiler backend for ARM, AVR, and x86 → **25% faster compatibility** and **15% faster compile times**.  
- Re-engineered data structures (dynamic arrays), achieving **3x faster execution** and **25% memory savings**.  
- Led large-scale automated testing (1M+ scenarios), cutting runtime by **25%** and memory use by **20%**.

# 🏆 Engineering Philosophy
> “Efficiency at scale is not just an optimization — it’s a mindset.”  

- 🧩 I believe backend engineering is about **simplifying complexity**.  
- 📊 I rely on **metrics (P90/P99 latencies, throughput, memory footprint)** to measure real success.  
- 🌍 My goal: build backend systems that remain **reliable, fast, and scalable** even under massive load.
